# BrightLight Data Analytics Coding Practical - SQL Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries for *Practical 1: SQL Fundamentals (Databricks-Basic SQL Syntax)* from BrightLight Data Analytics. The practical is designed to build a strong foundation in basic SQL syntax using the `retail_sales_dataset.csv` dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of retail transactions with the following columns:
- **Transaction_ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Date**: The date the transaction occurred (`YYYY-MM-DD` format).
- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male, Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer at the time of the transaction.
- **Product_Category**: Category of the purchased product (e.g., Beauty, Clothing, Electronics).
- **Quantity**: Number of product units purchased.
- **Price_per_Unit**: Cost of a single unit.
- **Total_Amount**: Total amount spent (`Quantity Ã— Price_per_Unit`).

## SQL Concepts Covered
This practical includes SQL queries for fundamental operations:
1. **SELECT Statements** - Retrieving data from a table.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT** - Extracting unique values.
3. **WHERE Clause** - Filtering records based on conditions.
4. **Aggregate Functions** - Performing calculations (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`).
5. **GROUP BY** - Aggregating data by categories.
6. **HAVING Clause** - Filtering grouped data.
7. **CASE Statements** - Creating conditional outputs.

## Instructions
- Ensure that the dataset `retail_sales_dataset.csv` is uploaded to your databricks account.
- Write one SQL query per question as outlined in *Practical 1*.
- Follow proper formatting and indentation.
- Use correct column names and expected output formats.
- Focus on SQL syntax rather than actual data.
